Background Context
Environment variables will be your best friend for this project!

HBNB_ENV: running environment. It can be “dev” or “test” for the moment (“production” soon!)
HBNB_MYSQL_USER: the username of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_PWD: the password of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST: the hostname of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_DB: the database name of your MySQL
HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE: the type of storage used. It can be “file” (using FileStorage) or db (using DBStorage)

Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
Python Unit Tests
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
All your test files and folders should start by test_
Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
SQL Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using MySQL 8.0
Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
All your files should end with a new line
All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
All your files should start by a comment describing the task
All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (SELECT, WHERE…)
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
The length of your files will be tested using wc
GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a partner’s project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.
